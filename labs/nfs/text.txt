2-1 Explain what the automounter is and how it works.
    An automounter is any program or software facility which automatically mounts filesystems in response to access operations by user programs. 
    An automounter system utility (daemon under Unix), when notified of file and directory access attempts under selectively monitored subdirectory trees, dynamically and transparently makes local or remote devices accessible.
    The automounter has the purpose of conserving local system resources and of reducing the coupling between systems which share filesystems with a number of servers. 

2-2 Explain what an automount map is, and the difference between direct and indirect maps.

    A master map provides:

    * a pointer to the direct, indirect, and built-in maps that automount is to use.
    * the mount point for each indirect and built-in map listed in this master map.
    * optionally, mount options that apply to all mounts in each map listed in this master map.

    Direct maps

    Direct maps are used to specify direct mounts and contain a separate entry for each direct mount point. A direct map entry can also contain pointers to other maps that automount should read (that is, nested maps). There can be more than one direct map. 

    Indirect automount maps

    Indirect maps are used to specify indirect mounts and contain a separate entry for each indirect mount point. An indirect map does not contain the full pathname of the indirect mount point. In this way, an indirect map is dependent on the master map, arguments to the automount command, or, through map nesting, a direct or indirect map. There can be more than one indirect map.


2-3 What is the purpose of an automounter? Why not use static network mounts instead.
